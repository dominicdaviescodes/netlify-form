A Traversy Media [Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ElQ689HRcY&t=413s)

Steps.
* We downloaded a html template
* extracted it from the zip file
* This template became the project folder
* the form was at bottom of template
* we added action="POST" data-netlify="true" to the opening form tag

that was it. Brad added 2 more fields to flesh it out a bit but that was it.

* push to git and deploy to netlify
* you can check form submissions in netlify, I think you get 100 submissions for free monthly.
